Home to stage 62, a theatre group that puts on musicals. I recently saw Sideshow and Evita here. Great sound and comfortable chairs, an all around pleasant experience for a pleasant evening or Sunday matinee. Plenty of free parking and at only 18 dollars its a true bargain. \n\nAnd yes, the rumors are true, this building is haunted.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1_lU0-eSWJCRvNGk78Zh9Q"}
